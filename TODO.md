# TODOs

* add a way of ordering extensions, by e.g. providing a "weight" property
* Find a way of checking "orphaned" hooks: hooks that have no extensions, and extensions that extend non-existing extensionpoints. This way errors could be detected when creating extensions with "spelling error" hooks.
